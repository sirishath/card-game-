# card-game-
It can also be called as skip3 py game. 
All the files required for this game are given here. 
Make sure you import each of the files given here like I have done. 
Also I have uploaded two versions of it. 
1) The one in which user only has 5 chances after all the cards have been dealt.
2) The one in which user has infinite chances even after the cards have been dealt.
   Note: This code might have some issue running in your device because its writted by a begginer.
